📋 Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Mini Project: To-Do List Application"! 📋

During my third week of internship with "VaultofCodes," I had the fantastic opportunity to work on a mini project that challenged my programming skills and understanding of data structures. This repository showcases the result of my hard work and dedication in creating a basic yet efficient to-do list application.

📝 Task Overview:
For this project, I was tasked with developing a to-do list application using functions and data structures. This assignment pushed me to think critically about how to manage tasks efficiently, implement user-friendly features, and optimize the code for performance.
